# Emotion Recognition Game for Children

This project is an interactive game designed to help children with the autism spectrum — recognize facial expressions and understand emotions through repeated exposure and adaptive learning.

## Purpose

The game supports emotional learning by showing children images of faces expressing different emotions and asking them to select the correct label. The game exists in two versions:
- **Automatic Difficulty**: The game adjusts the difficulty level in real-time based on the child’s performance.
- **Manual Difficulty**: A fixed difficulty level is used.
This repository presents you with the automatic version.

## How to Run the Game

Run the game by executing:
python EmotionGame.py

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
To install required libraries, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Acknowledgements

This game is based on research suggesting that even passive exposure to emotional images with labels can improve emotion recognition skills in children. Thank you for helping test and develop this tool.
